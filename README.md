## Features

With this app, you can access your favorite third wave coffee shops offline and on-the-go. The next time you visit a new city and plan to get some good coffee in the neighbourhood, open up the app and see the directions to the cafe that matches Your criterias:

- Currently we are only available in Budapest - but we are expanding fast!
- Filter by brewing method, bean origin and bean roast
- See the grinder and espresso machine each cafe uses
- See what brewing method and beans you could try!

If you have any suggestions on how to improve this experience in the future, or you just miss a city, cafe, roaster or a feature ðŸ‘‰ submit an [Issue](https://github.com/thirdwavelist/android/issues).
